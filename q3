A.  Explain how digital signature works with public/private keypairs.
=>  The digital signature is used to secure the file's copyright ownership while allowing the public to access it thus there are two keys involved in it, public and private. Private key is known only by the person who owns it while public key can be shared to other people. Private key can generate the public key showing the the proof of existence and ownership.

B.  Identify your favorite Java project this semester.  
=>  My favourite java project was the Merkle tree where we had to deal with hash as well as tree nodes.

    Describe two things you learned by doing the project.
    =>  I learned how to construct a merkle tree with the hashes of the files and create one mother hash and also I learned to make nodes(double way nodes) and learned how to connect them in a certain order.
    
    Describe two ways in which the project could be improved or expanded.
    =>  We can add more dimensions to the tree so that we can stack a lot of different tress and connect them. We can also use merkle tree to create our own blockchain.
    
C.  Describe two advantages of object-oriented programming.
    =>  It is easy to debug because it is seperated into different sections.
        Objects are flexible and thus can be changed and used in multiple ways.
        
    Describe two disadvantages of object-oriented programming.
    =>  The content is big and so it requires a lot of coding and bigger space. 
        They are slower because a lot of executions are in need to be done.
    
D.  Consider the following PYTHON code for the MNode class given below.
    What is the difference in the way Python and Java handle the declaration of datatypes?
    =>  In java, once you declare any object of a specific datatype, you cant change it while in Python it is possible to do.
    
    Explain the difference in how constructors are written in Python vs Java.
    =>  In Java, we have to declare whether the method is public or private and needs more information input from the coder to run while python is not as specific about the attributes of certain things.
    
    Which language do you prefer?  Explain why.
    =>  I prefer Java, because we learned it recently ;) moreover I get confused with the indentation in python sometimes so its becomes more difficult. Also Java is more simple.
